# Python Dice Roller

Console app game that tests your luck and rolls dice!

Bug: I am currently working on an issue that deals with Importing issues. I will be diving back and taking a look at this later this evening. Numerous stack overflow posts mention that I must have a duplicate Random.py file in my project, however main.py is the only file in the project. The error occurs when you press anything other than Q to end the game.
